# encrypted-server-execution
this file is quite simple, it takes from a localhost server, python commands encrypted with fernet(cryptography module), and it decrypts them with a key and executes them. In a sense creating a program that can execute code externally.

<h1>To use: </h1>    
change the local server/ running server with the variable name local_com         
change the key to your specific key                
and using the fernet encryption create python code that can be executed on the server, and put on it there.
